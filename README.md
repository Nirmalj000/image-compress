# Image Compressor Web App

A simple, client-side web application for compressing images using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This app allows users to upload an image, adjust the compression quality, and download the compressed versionâ€”all without requiring any server-side processing.

## Features

- **Client-Side Compression**: All image processing is done in the browser, keeping user data private and ensuring fast processing.
- **Real-Time Quality Adjustment**: Adjust the compression quality with a slider to balance file size and image clarity.
- **Preview of Original and Compressed Images**: See both the original and compressed images side-by-side to compare quality.
- **Download Option**: Download the compressed image in JPEG or PNG format, depending on the original image's format.

## Technology Stack

- **HTML** for the layout
- **CSS** for styling
- **JavaScript** for image processing and compression

## Demo

You can try out the app by simply opening the HTML file in a browser. No setup required!

## How to Use

1. **Upload an Image**: Click the "Choose File" button and select an image from your device.
2. **Adjust Quality**: Use the quality slider to set the compression level (lower values increase compression but may reduce quality).
3. **Download Compressed Image**: Click the "Download Compressed Image" button to save the compressed version.

## Project Structure

The entire application is contained within a single HTML file, including inline CSS and JavaScript for simplicity.

### File

- **index.html**: Contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for the app. Simply open this file in a browser to start using the app.

## Compression Settings

The app uses a canvas element to handle image processing. You can control the compression quality with the slider:

- **PNG Images**: Retain transparency and do not use quality settings (saved in lossless format).
- **JPEG Images**: Use the quality setting to adjust compression, with values ranging from `0.1` (high compression) to `1.0` (low compression, higher quality).

## Limitations

- **File Size and Resolution**: Very large images may cause performance issues or fail to load due to browser memory limits.
- **Transparency**: For images with transparency (e.g., PNGs), the app defaults to PNG format. However, converting these to JPEG will remove transparency, filling transparent areas with a white background.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements could include:

- **Advanced Compression Algorithms**: Using libraries like Pica or Compress.js for higher-quality compression.
- **Image Resizing**: Optionally resize images before compression for even greater file size reduction.
- **Multiple File Uploads**: Enable batch processing for compressing multiple images at once.
